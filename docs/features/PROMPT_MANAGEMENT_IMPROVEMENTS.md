# Prompt Management Improvements

## Features Implemented

### 1. Delete Functionality (Already Existed)
The delete functionality was already implemented in the Prompt Library with:
- **Delete button** in both Grid and List views
- **Confirmation dialog** before deletion
- **Visual feedback** with red color for delete action
- **Proper error handling** with toast notifications

### 2. AI-Powered Prompt Name Generation
Implemented an intelligent name generation feature that:

#### Backend (`/api/prompts/generate-name`)
- Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash model for fast generation
- Creates descriptive, concise names (3-6 words)
- Follows title case convention
- Avoids generic terms
- Falls back to simple extraction if AI fails

#### Frontend Improvements
- **Loading state** with spinner during generation
- **Disabled state** to prevent multiple clicks
- **Error handling** with fallback to simple extraction
- **Smooth UX** with instant feedback

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoint
```python
@router.post("/prompts/generate-name")
async def generate_prompt_name(prompt: str) -> dict:
    # Uses AI to analyze prompt and generate descriptive name
    # Returns: {"name": "Generated Name"}
```

### AI Prompt Engineering
The system uses a carefully crafted prompt to generate names:
- Analyzes the main purpose of the prompt
- Generates concise, descriptive names
- Uses title case formatting
- Focuses on functionality
- Avoids generic terms

### User Experience
1. User clicks "Auto-generate" button
2. Button shows loading spinner and "Generating..." text
3. AI analyzes the prompt content
4. Descriptive name appears in the input field
5. User can edit if needed

## Benefits

1. **Time Saving**: No need to manually think of names
2. **Consistency**: AI generates consistent naming patterns
3. **Descriptive**: Names clearly indicate prompt purpose
4. **Professional**: Well-formatted, meaningful names
5. **Fallback**: Simple extraction if AI is unavailable

## Usage Example

**Original Prompt:**
```
You are a professional translator. Translate the following text from English to French, maintaining the tone and context.
```

**AI-Generated Name:**
```
English To French Professional Translator
```

## Error Handling

- Network failures: Falls back to simple extraction
- AI errors: Uses first 5 words of prompt
- Empty prompts: Defaults to "My Prompt"
- Long names: Truncates to 100 characters

## Performance

- Uses fast Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- Typically generates names in < 1 second
- No impact on save operation if generation fails
- Asynchronous operation doesn't block UI
