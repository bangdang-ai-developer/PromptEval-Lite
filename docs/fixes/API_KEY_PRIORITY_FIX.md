# API Key Priority Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
- User-provided API keys were not being used when server had placeholder keys
- Saved API keys functionality was incomplete
- No clear error messages for placeholder/invalid keys
- Inconsistent behavior between test generation and scoring

## Implementation

### 1. Fixed API Key Priority (multi_model_service.py)
- Changed from `api_key or settings.api_key` to `api_key if api_key else settings.api_key`
- Ensures user-provided keys are always used first
- Server keys are only used as fallback

### 2. Added Placeholder Key Detection
- Created `_is_placeholder_key()` method in MultiModelService
- Created `is_placeholder_key()` static method in APIKeyValidator
- Detects common placeholder patterns: "your_", "_here", "xxx", "placeholder", "change_me", etc.
- Throws clear error messages when placeholder keys are detected

### 3. Implemented Saved API Key Resolution (main.py)
- Added logic to handle "saved:id" format from frontend
- Fetches encrypted key from database for authenticated users
- Decrypts the key before using it
- Requires authentication for saved key usage

### 4. Fixed Evaluator Model Key Selection
- Changed evaluator to use user-provided key first (not server key)
- Ensures consistent behavior across all operations

### 5. Enhanced Error Messages
- Backend provides clear messages for API key issues
- Frontend enhances error messages with helpful suggestions
- Users get guidance on how to fix API key problems

## Testing
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python scripts/test_api_key_priority.py
```

## Usage
1. **Manual API Key**: Enter key directly in the UI
2. **Saved API Key**: Select from dropdown (authenticated users)
3. **Server Key**: Leave empty to use server-configured key (if valid)

## Benefits
- User keys always take priority
- Saved keys work properly
- Clear error messages guide users
- Consistent behavior across all operations
- No more "API key not valid" errors when user provides valid key
