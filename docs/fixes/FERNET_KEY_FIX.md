# Fernet Encryption Key Fix

## Issue
The error "Fernet key must be 32 url-safe base64-encoded bytes" occurs when the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `.env` file is not in the correct format.

## Solution

### 1. Generate a Valid Fernet Key

Run the provided script:
```bash
python scripts/generate_fernet_key.py
```

This will output something like:
```
Generated Fernet Key:
xfIAcWzNriegn8nGT0LuxRIilpl8iL2E82x5w-G2jgQ=

Add this to your .env file:
ENCRYPTION_KEY=xfIAcWzNriegn8nGT0LuxRIilpl8iL2E82x5w-G2jgQ=
```

### 2. Update Your .env File

Replace the placeholder encryption key in your `.env` file with the generated key:
```
ENCRYPTION_KEY=xfIAcWzNriegn8nGT0LuxRIilpl8iL2E82x5w-G2jgQ=
```

### 3. Restart the Application

The application will now properly initialize the Fernet encryption for storing API keys securely.

## What is Fernet?

Fernet is a symmetric encryption method that:
- Ensures encrypted messages cannot be manipulated or read without the key
- Uses AES 128 in CBC mode with HMAC for authentication
- Requires a 32-byte key that is URL-safe base64-encoded

## When is this Used?

The encryption key is used when:
- Users save API keys in the database (requires authentication)
- The system needs to decrypt saved API keys for use
- Protecting sensitive data at rest

## Running Without Database

If you're running without a database (`ENABLE_DATABASE=false`), you can leave the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` empty or use a placeholder value as it won't be used.
